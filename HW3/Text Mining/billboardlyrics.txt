Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's role play, I wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck

But let me tell you how I got this ring (ayy, ayy)
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down inside of me
Quick jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be
I run down on him 'fore I have a nigga running me
Talk your shit, bite your lip
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (while you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang
He already made his mind up 'fore he came
Now get your boots and your coat
For this wet ass pussy
He bought a phone just for pictures
Of this wet ass pussy
Pay my tuition just to kiss me
On this wet ass pussy
Now make it rain if you wanna
See some wet ass pussy
Look, I need a hard hitter, I need a deep stroker
I need a Henny drinker, I need a weed smoker
Not a garden snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1, just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that little dangly dang
That swang in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's going in dry and it's coming out soggy
I ride on that thang like the cops is behind me
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheating
Put him on his knees, give him something to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm looking for a beating
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make you bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask, "Whose is it?"
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name
Ah

If I woke up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of keeping me comin' back to back
I just found out the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin' I feel it in the air
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that (your savage)
Baby, I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of making me spend up all my cash
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love

Your savage love (savage love)
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Girl, you could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, some can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
